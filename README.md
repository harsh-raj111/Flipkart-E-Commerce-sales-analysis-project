This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis of a large-scale e-commerce dataset to uncover key drivers of revenue, demand, and customer behavior. The analysis focuses on translating raw transactional data into actionable business insights that can support pricing strategy, inventory planning, and operational decisions.
🎯 Problem Statement
E-commerce platforms handle thousands of products across multiple categories, sellers, and price ranges. Identifying what drives sales performance is critical for optimizing revenue and customer satisfaction.
This project answers:
Which categories and products drive the most revenue?
